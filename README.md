## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox, for the card
- CSS Grid, for the layout


### Continued development

In this project I added a mediaquery to make it responsive. But I still need to delve into that topic. I would like card grown horizontal and vertlicaly when viewport is in landscape orientation.

### Useful resources
